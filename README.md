# dot-files for Mac

This repo is used by me in order to set up Mac ZSH by installing some handy tools and scripts along with their plugins and aliases.

## Content

The main components in this repo are the hidden shell files and one config file for ssh connnection listing.

## Installation

1. Clone this repo to a proper place in your home directory.

    ```sh
    mkdir ~/.dot-files
    cd ~/.dot-files
    git clone git@github.com:zafatar/dot-files.git .
    ```

1. Run the installation script.

    ```sh
    ./install.sh
    ```

## Future works

- (WIP) Add an installation script which makes the installation seamless.

- (WIP) Checks for the shell types (BASH or zsh)
