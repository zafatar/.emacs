# .dot-files for Mac OSX and Linux

This repo is used by me in order to set up ZSH by installing some handy tools, applications and scripts along with their plugins and aliases.

## Content

The main components in this repo are the hidden shell files and one config file for ssh connnection listing.

## Installation

1. Clone this repo to a proper place in your home directory.

    ```sh
    mkdir ~/.dot-files
    cd ~/.dot-files
    git clone git@github.com:zafatar/dot-files.git .
    ```

1. Run the installation script.

    ```sh

    ```

## Future works

- Stable install script for re-installation and update. 

- Test scripts on different OSs (if possible).
